My First Game Using the Pygame module.

In this game, you take on the role of a ball with a mission: to catch as many bananas as possible! You can move the ball using the arrow keys on your keyboard.

But beware! A purple butterfly will start chasing you, adding an element of danger to your adventure. Each time you collect a yellow square (banana), your ball grows larger, making the game progressively more challenging.

The game features a simple high score system and an easy-to-navigate menu.

HAVE FUN PLAYING!

In to do list for future are graphics (Ball should look like monkey and butterfly, hmmm butterfly.)
