## Introduction
My First Game Using the Pygame module. The project was almost entirely vibe coded since I wanted to try what I could build with prompting the Copilot. 

In this game, you take on the role of a ball with a mission: to catch as many bananas as possible! You can move the ball using the arrow keys on your keyboard.

But beware! A purple butterfly will start chasing you, adding an element of danger to your adventure. Each time you collect a yellow square (banana), your ball grows larger, making the game progressively more challenging.

The game features a simple high score system and an easy-to-navigate menu.

HAVE FUN PLAYING!

## To Do
In to do list for future are graphics (Ball should look like monkey and butterfly, hmmm butterfly.)

## Release
Release is built with GitHub Actions and runs on Windows machines. There is no Mac or Linux version yet.
